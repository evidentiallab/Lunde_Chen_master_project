\section{Introduction}
%\IEEEPARstart{S}{martphones} are becoming increasingly popular and have emerged as a particularly appealing platform for network
% applications, especially through Wi-Fi interface.
%However, these light-weighted and easy-to-carry mobile devices are constrained by their limited battery capacity.
\section{Wi-Fi Energy Consumption  From A Usage Perspective}
While the energy consumption of Wi-Fi can be modelled with packet-level information and other factors, 
we find that the dominating factor of Wi-Fi energy consumption comes from the bursts of traffic.
For example, in our previous work of achieving energy saving of Wi-Fi regarding to Rssi, we found that 
Wi-Fi energy consumption can be seen as proportional to the time it takes to download a file. 

As a result, to achieve energy saving, the key is that the bursts of data should be smart.
We investigate the key factors that influence the burstness of Wi-Fi. 
We determine that Rssi, data scheduling and smartphone usage play important roles.
\subsection{Rssi}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[scale=0.95]{rssi_energy.eps}
\caption{Energy Consumption in different Rssi}
\label{rssi_energy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Scheduling}
For delay-tolerant data, batching them in a single burst can achieve significant energy saving. 
As we measured, downloading a file of 500 KB via HTTP cost the same energy as downloading 
4 files of 500 KB, as shown in Figure 1. On the one hand, Wi-Fi has very high throughput, and mobile data is generally of 
small size [3]. On the other hand, 97\% of mobile data is HTTP-based [3], 
which involves the initiation and the closure of HTTP connection, batching several 
HTTP data can make the time of download overlap. The overhead of maintaining multiple TCP connections
can be ignored.
\subsection{Smartphone Usage}
As we found, when the smartphone is in usage, the energy cost of Wi-Fi interface is lower than when the phone 
is screen-locked. So we can exploit this for energy saving.

Applications with network permission could open the Wi-Fi interface periodically for little data transmission, even when the phone is screen-locked and not used. This could represent a huge amount of energy consumption, especially when many such applications are installed in the smartphone.
However, as [1] shows, Android smartphone users usually use only 20\% of their installed applications the most frequently, but rarely use other applications.
So we could use Iptables to block the Internet access of these rarely-used applications to save energy.

\section{Green Wi-Fi Design}

\subsection{Architecture}
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
As shown in Fig. 3.
\subsection{Decision Engine}
The input of the decision engine: Rssi, Wi-Fi SSID, HTTP data size and their delay-tolerance, application usage history data, 
remained battery.

The intermediate output of the decision engine: FSM of Wi-Fi state, max throughput of Wi-Fi AP

The final output of the decision engine: Transfer data or not, which applications to block/unblock with Iptables.

\subsection{Implementation}
Implementation: The Green Engine, the GreenHTTPService framework, multiple test applications GreenApp1, GreenApp2, GreenApp3 ... and also GreenWiPower which blocks the Internet access of rarely-used applications installed by a specific user.

\section{Experimental Results}
Comparision of battery lifetime with and without Green Wi-Fi.
